# ntHash bug?

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/luizirber/nthash_bug/master?filepath=analysis.ipynb)

Analysis of a possible bug in the ntHash code (or maybe I'm missing something
obvious in my implementations...)

I recommend clicking on the "Launch binder" button above and exploring the
notebook interactively (GitHub doesn't keep some of the formatting).
Alternatively, use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/luizirber/nthash_bug/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) (which preserves the formatting).
